##  About Me
I'm a cybersecurity student at the University of South Florida (Honors College), focused on **cloud security**, **application security**, and **real-world offensive testing**. I interned at Wells Fargo and Honeywell, completed externships with **JPMorgan Chase**, **Verizon**, and **Accenture**, built secure cloud IAM pipelines, and regularly compete in national CTFs with USF CyberHerd.


I'm currently building:
- Secure IaC modules with `terraform test`
- CI/CD pipelines that self-heal and auto-enforce security
- Writeups from stego, web, and reverse engineering challenges
- 
My GitHub is where I prove—not just say—that I do the work.
